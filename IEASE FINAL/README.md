# IEASE - Interactive Education And Seamless Exam Management

## Overview

IEASE (Interactive Education And Seamless Exam Management) is a comprehensive web application designed to enhance the educational experience by providing interactive tools for learning and efficient management of exam-related tasks. The project integrates two main features: **Air Canvas** for interactive learning and **Exam Management** for seamless exam organization.

---

## Features

### 1. **Air Canvas**
- **Interactive Drawing**: Users can draw in the air using hand gestures captured via a webcam. The system recognizes hand movements and translates them into drawings on a virtual canvas.
- **Gesture Recognition**: The application uses MediaPipe's hand tracking to detect and interpret hand gestures, allowing users to draw shapes like circles, squares, and freehand lines.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The canvas updates in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback as users draw.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: The drawn content can be analyzed using Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to provide solutions and explanations for mathematical equations or questions drawn on the canvas.
- **Customizable Drawing Modes**: Users can switch between different drawing modes (e.g., freehand, shapes) and reset the canvas as needed.

### 2. **Exam Management**
- **Room Management**: Administrators can add exam rooms with details such as room number, number of benches, rows, and columns.
- **Student Data Upload**: Student details can be uploaded via CSV files, which are validated to ensure correct formatting and department consistency.
- **Faculty Assignment**: Faculty members can be assigned to exam rooms based on the number of students in each room. The system automatically assigns faculties, ensuring proper supervision.
- **Seating Arrangement Generation**: The system generates a seating arrangement for students across multiple rooms, ensuring optimal utilization of space and resources.
- **Data Clearing**: Administrators can clear all uploaded data (rooms, students, and faculties) to start fresh.
